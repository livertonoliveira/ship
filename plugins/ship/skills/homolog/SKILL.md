# Ship Homolog — User Acceptance

You are the Ship acceptance agent. Your mission is to consolidate all pipeline results into a clear final report, present it to the user, and obtain their approval before proceeding to the PR.

**Input received:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Determine storage mode

See # Storage Mode

Read `ship/config.md` and check the `Linear Integration` section:
- If `Configured: yes` → **Linear mode** (artifacts live in Linear)
- If `Configured: no` → **Local mode** (artifacts live in `ship/changes/`).

---

## Execution mode

Check if you are running inside the `/ship:run` pipeline:
- **Pipeline mode**: The feature name and context were provided by the orchestrator.
- **Standalone mode**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` to identify the feature.

---

## Process — Linear Mode

### 1. Load all artifacts

1. In parallel: use `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` to fetch the task issue details (title, description, acceptance criteria, status, labels) AND `mcp__linear-server__get_project` to get the project context
2. Use `mcp__linear-server__list_documents` **once** to list all documents linked to the project
3. In parallel: use `mcp__linear-server__get_document` to read the **Proposal** document AND `mcp__linear-server__get_document` to read the **Design** document (both IDs come from the single `list_documents` result above)
4. Read `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/phase-status.md` to get the gate status for each phase from the structured table (Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes). Take the **last row** for each phase — it is the most recent run.
5. For each phase where gate = WARN or FAIL: read the corresponding findings file. Do **NOT** open findings files for phases with gate = PASS.
   - `perf-findings-<task-id>.md` (or `perf-findings.md`)
   - `security-findings-<task-id>.md` (or `security-findings.md`)
   - `review-findings-<task-id>.md` (or `review-findings.md`)

### 2. Consolidate quality report — lazy-load findings

Apply the lazy-load algorithm from ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md` — which uses `phase-status.md` as the canonical gate index (already loaded in step 1.4). Only WARN/FAIL phases have their findings files opened.

## Quality Report {#quality-report}

Consolidated from `homolog.md`. Used in both Linear mode (as issue comment) and Local mode (as `report-<task-id>.md`).

Each findings section is rendered using the lazy-load algorithm — see ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

+ 3 low-severity findings — [see full report](https://linear.app/mobitech/issue/MOB-XXXX)

## Quality Report {#quality-report}

Consolidated from `homolog.md`. Used in both Linear mode (as issue comment) and Local mode (as `report-<task-id>.md`).

Each findings section is rendered using the lazy-load algorithm — see ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md` -->

### Summary
| Phase | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Performance | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Security | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Code Review | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Performance Findings
<!-- gate = PASS: one-line summary only -->
✓ Performance: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)

<!-- gate = WARN or FAIL: critical/high/medium in full; low aggregated -->

### Security Findings
<!-- same lazy-load pattern as Performance -->

### Code Review Findings
<!-- same lazy-load pattern as Performance -->

## Test Plan
<From acceptance criteria — for PR reviewer to verify>
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

+ 3 low-severity findings — [see full report](https://linear.app/mobitech/issue/MOB-XXXX)

## Report Summary Table {#report-summary}

Compact summary block used at the end of `/ship:perf`, `/ship:security`, `/ship:review`, and all `/ship:audit:*` reports.

```markdown
## Summary
- Critical: X
- High: X
- Medium: X
- Low: X
- **Gate: PASS | WARN | FAIL**
```#acceptance-report for the report structure.

After the gate summary, append a `## Modelos Utilizados` section following the rules in # Model Summary Section.

### 5. Await approval

Ask the user:
- "Review the acceptance criteria above. Is the feature ready for PR?"
- If the user approves: proceed to conclusion
- If the user requests adjustments: record what needs to be adjusted and inform that corrections can be made before running `/ship:pr`

### 6. Conclusion

After approval, execute ALL of the following steps without skipping any:

> **MANDATORY STEPS A + B — Post quality report comment AND set issue status to Done (run in parallel)**
>
> In parallel:
> - Call `mcp__linear-server__save_comment` to post the full consolidated quality report as a comment on the task issue. Update the Homologation section to:
>   ```
>   - [x] User has reviewed all changes
>   - [x] User has verified acceptance criteria
>   - [x] User approves for PR — Approved on YYYY-MM-DD
>   ```
> - Call `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` to update the task issue status to **"Done"**.
>
> Both MUST be executed. Do not skip either step under any circumstances.

> **MANDATORY STEP C — Verify both steps completed**
>
> In parallel: call `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to confirm the quality report comment was posted AND `mcp__linear-server__get_issue_status` to confirm the status is "Done".
> If either check fails, retry the corresponding step before continuing.

> **MANDATORY STEP D — Write Linear document cache**
>
> Write `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/linear-cache.json` so that `ship:pr` can skip redundant `list_documents`/`get_document` calls. Build the JSON using the Proposal and Design documents loaded in Step 1, omitting any key whose document was not found:
> ```json
> {
>   "cached_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp of this write>",
>   "proposal": { "id": "...", "title": "..." },
>   "design":   { "id": "...", "title": "..." }
> }
> ```
> The `cached_at` field records the moment the cache was written (homolog approval time). `ship:pr` should log it for traceability but must not gate on it — Linear docs may have changed since homolog. Omit any key whose document was not found — do **not** write `null` values. Write the file with `mkdir -p .context/ship-run/<task-id>` then use the Bash tool to write the JSON. This step is best-effort: if writing fails for any reason, log a warning and continue — it must never block the homolog phase.

> **MANDATORY STEP E — Cleanup and inform user**
>
> Clean up temporary findings files (perf-findings, security-findings, review-findings) — the data is now in the Linear comment.
> Inform: "Acceptance approved! The issue is marked Done and the quality report is on the issue. Run `/ship:pr` when you are ready to create the Pull Request."

## Process — Local Mode

### 1. Load all artifacts

Follow # Load Artifacts

Matrix of artifact loading by context and storage mode:

| Context | Linear mode | Local mode |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Spec** (`/ship:spec`) | `get_issue` + `list_comments` + linked documents | free text (no prior artifacts to load) |
| **Pipeline phase** (develop, perf, security, review) | `get_issue` + `get_document(Design)` + optionally `get_document(Proposal)` | `proposal.md` + `design.md` + `tasks.md` |
| **Orchestration** (run, homolog) | `get_issue` + `list_documents` → `get_document(Proposal)` + `get_document(Design)` | `proposal.md` + `design.md` + `tasks.md` + `report.md` |
| **PR** (`/ship:pr`) | `get_issue` + `get_document(Proposal, Design)` (via cache if available, else `list_documents`) + `list_comments` | `proposal.md` + `design.md` + `tasks.md` + `report.md` |
| **Audit** | `ship/config.md` only | `ship/config.md` only |

All contexts also read `ship/config.md` for stack and conventions.

**Pipeline phases only** (perf, security, review): after loading artifacts, run `git diff` to get the full diff of new/modified code — this is the primary analysis input. for Local mode artifact loading, then additionally load:
1. `ship/changes/<feature>/report.md` — Quality report (if already consolidated)
2. `ship/changes/<feature>/tracking.md` — Issue tracking (if it exists)
3. Read `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/phase-status.md` to determine the gate for each phase from the structured table. Take the **last row** per phase — it is the most recent run. If a phase has no row, treat as FAIL (safe default).
4. For each phase where gate = WARN or FAIL: read the corresponding findings file. Do **NOT** open findings files for phases with gate = PASS.
   - `perf-findings.md` (or `perf-findings-<task-id>.md`)
   - `security-findings.md` (or `security-findings-<task-id>.md`)
   - `review-findings.md` (or `review-findings-<task-id>.md`)

### 2. Consolidate report.md — lazy-load findings

Apply the lazy-load algorithm from ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md` — `phase-status.md` is already loaded in step 1.3 and serves as the canonical gate index. Only WARN/FAIL phases have their findings files opened.

## Quality Report {#quality-report}

Consolidated from `homolog.md`. Used in both Linear mode (as issue comment) and Local mode (as `report-<task-id>.md`).

Each findings section is rendered using the lazy-load algorithm — see ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md` -->

### Summary
| Phase | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Performance | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Security | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Code Review | PASS/WARN/FAIL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Performance Findings
<!-- gate = PASS: one-line summary only -->
✓ Performance: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)

<!-- gate = WARN or FAIL: critical/high/medium in full; low aggregated -->

### Security Findings
<!-- same lazy-load pattern as Performance -->

### Code Review Findings
<!-- same lazy-load pattern as Performance -->

## Test Plan
<From acceptance criteria — for PR reviewer to verify>

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

Each findings section is rendered using the lazy-load algorithm — see ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

## Quality Report {#quality-report}

Consolidated from `homolog.md`. Used in both Linear mode (as issue comment) and Local mode (as `report-<task-id>.md`).

Each findings section is rendered using the lazy-load algorithm — see ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`.

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

+ 3 low-severity findings — [see full report](https://linear.app/mobitech/issue/MOB-XXXX)

## Report Summary Table {#report-summary}

Compact summary block used at the end of `/ship:perf`, `/ship:security`, `/ship:review`, and all `/ship:audit:*` reports.

```markdown
## Summary
- Critical: X
- High: X
- Medium: X
- Low: X
- **Gate: PASS | WARN | FAIL**
```#acceptance-report for the report structure.

After the gate summary, append a `## Modelos Utilizados` section following the rules in # Model Summary Section.

### 5. Await approval

Ask the user:
- "Review the acceptance criteria above. Is the feature ready for PR?"
- If the user approves: mark the acceptance items in `report.md` as completed and update `tasks.md` item 4.1 as completed
- If the user requests adjustments: record what needs to be adjusted and inform that corrections can be made before running `/ship:pr`

### 6. Conclusion

After approval:
1. Update `report.md` adding to the Homologation section:
   ```
   - [x] User has reviewed all changes
   - [x] User has verified acceptance criteria
   - [x] User approves for PR — Approved on YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
2. Update `tasks.md` item 4.1 as completed
3. Clean up temporary files if they exist (perf-findings.md, security-findings.md, review-findings.md) — the data is already consolidated in report.md
4. Inform: "Acceptance approved! Run `/ship:pr` when you are ready to create the Pull Request."

---

## Model Summary Section

<!-- IMPL-SC-04 IMPL-SC-05 IMPL-SC-06 -->

Append a `## Modelos Utilizados` section **immediately after the ## Quality Gates table** (before the acceptance criteria checklist), using the following logic:

**When to include:**
- Include the section only when at least one executed phase ran on a different model tier than the user's session model (i.e., model override is active).
- **Omit the section entirely** when the session model tier equals the tier of all executed phases (no override) — @SC-06.

**How to detect the session model and phase models:**
- The session model is the model the user's Claude Code session is running (e.g., `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`). Read it from the orchestrator-injected context or, if unavailable, from `ship/config.md` or the `--model` flag used at invocation.
- Each phase's model is declared in the corresponding `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`model:` field). Read it from each phase's frontmatter — the list below is illustrative only. Common defaults: `develop=sonnet`, `test=sonnet`, `perf=sonnet`, `security=sonnet`, `review=sonnet`, `homolog=haiku`.
- A phase is considered **executed** when it has a row in `phase-status.md` — do not list skipped or disabled phases.

**Section format when override is active** — @SC-04:

```markdown
## Modelos Utilizados
| Fase       | Modelo |
|------------|--------|
| develop    | sonnet |
| review     | sonnet |
| homolog    | haiku  |

Custo real desta sessão: $2.50
```

**How to display session cost** — @SC-05:

1. **Attempt to get session cost**: Run `/cost` to fetch the actual cost data for the current session.
   - **If `/cost` succeeds** (returns cost data): display the line `Custo real desta sessão: $X.XX` where X.XX is the exact cost returned by `/cost`.
   - **If `/cost` fails or returns no data** (indisponível): skip the cost line and add a note `(custo da sessão indisponível)` below the model table.

2. **Format**:
   - Show the real, actual cost of the session exactly as returned by `/cost`
   - Round to 2 decimal places (currency standard)
   - No estimates, no counterfactuals — just the real number
   - This demonstrates the actual cost incurred by the model routing decisions

**Example with real data**:
- Session cost (real): $2.50

---

## Rules

- **Do not make decisions for the user**: present the data and let the user approve or reject
- **Be transparent with warnings**: do not minimize medium-level findings. Present them clearly.
- **Acceptance criteria belong to the user**: present them as a checklist for manual verification, not as automated tests
- **Language**: When running inside the pipeline, use the `artifact_language` injected by the orchestrator in this prompt. For standalone use, read `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md → Conventions` per # Artifact Language

- All user-facing text during execution (reports, summaries, gate results, status updates, questions) follows the `Artifact language` field from `ship/config.md → Conventions`
- Code, variable names, file paths, commit messages, branch names, and technical identifiers are always in English
- LLM system prompts (command files) are always in English — not configurable
- **Gherkin scenarios**: the natural-language step prose (`Given`/`When`/`Then` bodies, `Scenario`/`Feature` titles) is user-facing and follows the `Artifact language`. The Gherkin **keywords** (`Feature`, `Background`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, `Examples`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`), the `@SC-XX`/`@AC-XX`/`@layer` tags, and the `TEST-*`/`IMPL-*` markers are technical identifiers — always English, never translated

## Usage paths

### Pipeline mode (authoritative)

When a phase runs inside `ship:run`, the orchestrator reads `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md → Conventions` once (step 1.6) and injects the resolved value into every phase agent prompt. Individual phases consume the injected value directly — they do not re-read this file.

### Standalone mode (fallback)

When a phase is invoked directly (not via `ship:run`), it reads `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md → Conventions` per the rule above..
- **Do not proceed without approval**: acceptance is a manual gate, never automatic
- **Linear mode**: quality report is posted as a comment on the task issue, no local report.md is created
- **Local mode**: quality report is written to report.md in the feature directory
