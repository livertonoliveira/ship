# Artifact Language

- All user-facing text during execution (reports, summaries, gate results, status updates, questions) follows the `Artifact language` field from `ship/config.md → Conventions`
- Code, variable names, file paths, commit messages, branch names, and technical identifiers are always in English
- LLM system prompts (command files) are always in English — not configurable
- **Gherkin scenarios**: the natural-language step prose (`Given`/`When`/`Then` bodies, `Scenario`/`Feature` titles) is user-facing and follows the `Artifact language`. The Gherkin **keywords** (`Feature`, `Background`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, `Examples`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`), the `@SC-XX`/`@AC-XX`/`@layer` tags, and the `TEST-*`/`IMPL-*` markers are technical identifiers — always English, never translated

## Resolving artifact language

If `Artifact language` is already injected inline in the current prompt (e.g., by the `ship:run` orchestrator or a skill wrapper), use that value directly — do not re-read `ship/config.md`.

Otherwise, read `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md → Conventions`.
