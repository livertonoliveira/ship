# Run Context — Shared Scratch Between Agents

Temporary scratch pattern used by the `/ship:run` orchestrator to share context
between phase agents (develop, test, perf, security, review).

---

## Root directory

```
.context/ship-run/<task-id>/
```

`<task-id>` is the Linear issue identifier (e.g., `MOB-1140`) or, in local mode,
the feature slug (e.g., `my-feature`). The directory is ephemeral — never commit it
(see `.gitignore`).

> **`<task-id>` must contain only `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`. Never use values containing `/`, `..`, or spaces.**

## Canonical files

| File | Written by | Read by | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `stack.md` | orchestrator (run) | all agents | detected stack summary — language, runtime, framework, test runner |
| `diff.md` | orchestrator (run) | perf, security, review | output of `git diff` for the branch — full diff of new/modified code |
| `test-failures.md` | test agent | perf, security, review, homolog | list of test failures, if any; file absent = all passed |
| `phase-status.md` | orchestrator (creates); agents (append) | orchestrator, homolog, pr | accumulated status per phase — run number, timestamp, files analyzed, gate result, finding counts |
| `pre-quality-snapshot.sha` | orchestrator (run) | pr agent | HEAD commit SHA before quality phases — used to build the PR diff |

### `stack.md` format

```markdown
# Stack

- Language: TypeScript
- Runtime: Node.js 20+
- Framework: NestJS
- Test runner: vitest
- Package manager: npm
```

### `diff.md` format

Literal output of `git diff main...HEAD` (or the configured range), without truncation.

### `test-failures.md` format

Always written by the test agent — even if all tests passed (header-only = zero failures):

```markdown
# Test Failures

- src/auth/auth.service.ts (3 failures)
- src/users/users.repo.ts (1 failure)
```

When all tests pass, the file contains only the header:

```markdown
# Test Failures
```

Header-only (no bullet items) or absent file both indicate all tests passed.

### `phase-status.md` format

Each phase appends one row when it completes. Re-run iterations appear as additional rows with incremented run numbers. Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC.

```markdown
# Phase Status

| Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----------|-------|------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| develop | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:00:00Z | - | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| test | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:01:00Z | - | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| perf | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:02:00Z | src/runner.ts | warn | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | N+1 query detected |
| security | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:02:00Z | src/runner.ts, config.ts | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| review | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:02:00Z | src/runner.ts | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| perf | #2 | 2026-05-01T10:05:00Z | src/runner.ts | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | re-run cirúrgico |
```

### `pre-quality-snapshot.sha` format

Single-line file with the commit SHA:

```
a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

---

## Read/write conventions

- **Orchestrator** (`run.md`): sole owner of **creating** the directory and **writing**
  `stack.md`, `diff.md`, and `pre-quality-snapshot.sha` before launching any agent.
  Also creates `phase-status.md` with the empty header row at pipeline start.
- **Phase agents** (develop, test, perf, security, review): **read only** from existing files.
  The only write allowed is **appending** rows to `phase-status.md` upon phase completion.
- **Test agent**: always writes `test-failures.md` after execution — bullet items = failures,
  header-only = all tests passed.
- **No agent** may delete or overwrite files written by another agent.

---

## Lifecycle

| Moment | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Start of `/ship:run` | Orchestrator creates `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/` and populates initial files |
| During pipeline | Agents read and append as needed |
| End of `/ship:pr` | Orchestrator removes `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/` (recursive) |
| `--keep-context` flag in `/ship:pr` | Directory is preserved for manual inspection |

The parent directory `.context/ship-run/` may hold multiple `<task-id>/` subdirs if
parallel pipelines are running — never remove the parent, only the completed task's subdir.
