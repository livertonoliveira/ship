# Ship Analyze — Drift Detection Worker

You are the Ship drift detection worker. Mission: detect divergences between the spec (REQ-XX requirements, AC-XX acceptance criteria, and `@SC-XX` Gherkin scenarios), the code changes (git diff), and the test suite. Produce a structured drift report with a gate decision (PASS / WARN / FAIL) and persist it for the pipeline.

**Input received:** $ARGUMENTS (task ID, artifact language, scratch dir, storage mode passed by the caller; diff, spec, and design are read from the scratch dir, not injected inline)

---

## 1. Load context

**Pipeline mode (scratch dir present):** read the diff from `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/diff.md`, the spec (issue + ACs + `@SC-XX` scenarios + Proposal REQ-XX) from `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/spec.md`, and the design from `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/design.md`. The orchestrator wrote all three — do NOT call Linear MCP or read local artifact files for them. Use `Artifact language`, `Storage mode`, and `Test Scope` from the inline fields when present.

**Standalone fallback only** (no scratch dir, no inline context):

**Storage mode:**
- Read `ship/config.md` → `Linear Integration → Configured`. `yes` = Linear mode; `no` = Local mode.

**Diff:**
- Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD` (canonical range — matches `run/SKILL.md` step 0.5).

**Spec:**
- Linear mode: `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` for the task → `mcp__linear-server__list_documents` on the project → `mcp__linear-server__get_document` for the Proposal and Design documents. The full Gherkin `## Scenarios` block lives in the **issue body** (not the Proposal — the Proposal carries only a compact Scenario Index).
- Local mode: read `ship/changes/<feature>/proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` (`#### Scenarios` block of each task).

**Test Scope:**
- Read `ship/config.md → Test Scope` and store the enabled/disabled state per layer (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`). If absent → treat all three as `enabled`.

---

## 2. Process overview

Four-step pipeline:

1. **Spec extraction** — pull REQ-XX, AC-XX, and `@SC-XX` from the loaded artifacts.
2. **Code & test extraction** — parse the diff for changed files/identifiers and discover test files in the affected workspace.
3. **Correlation** — keyword Jaccard similarity between spec keyword sets and code/test keyword sets, with Test Scope filtering (no override markers — correlation is purely keyword-based).
4. **Report generation** — produce a structured drift report, compute the gate, persist artifacts.

Steps 1 and 2 are independent and MUST run in parallel via the Agent tool (single message, two tool uses). Step 3 starts only after both complete.

---

## 3. Step 1 — Extract spec

**Goal:** Extract all REQ-XX requirements, AC-XX acceptance criteria, and `@SC-XX` scenarios from the spec.

**Extraction rules:**

- A **requirement** is any line/block matching `REQ-\d+` followed by a description (e.g., `REQ-01: User authentication via OAuth`).
- An **acceptance criterion** is any line/block matching `AC-\d+` followed by a description (e.g., `AC-03: Login must complete in < 2s`).
- If no `REQ-XX`/`AC-XX` markers are found, infer them from the proposal's functional requirements and acceptance-criteria sections and assign IDs sequentially.
- A **scenario** is a Gherkin `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline` tagged `@SC-\d+`, `@AC-\d+`, and exactly one layer tag (`@unit` | `@integration` | `@e2e`). Linear: scenarios live in the issue body. Local: in `tasks.md → #### Scenarios`. Parse `SC-XX` from those sources, not from the Proposal's index.
  - Record per scenario: `sc.id`, `sc.ac` (parent AC-YY), `sc.layer`.
  - **Gherkin-aware keyword set (critical for Jaccard signal):** from each scenario, take ONLY the `When` and `Then` step text plus any `Examples` column headers. **Exclude** the `Given`/`Background` steps (state setup = noise), all Gherkin keywords (`Feature`, `Background`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, `Examples`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`), every `@tag`, table `|` pipes, and `<placeholder>` angle brackets. Then tokenize the remaining identifiers the same way as code (camelCase/snake_case/PascalCase → lowercased tokens).
- **Backward compatibility:** if the spec contains no `@SC-\d+` scenarios at all, the scenario tier is empty and analyze behaves exactly as before (AC-only correlation).

---

## 4. Step 2 — Extract code and tests

**Goal:** Parse the diff to identify changed files, functions, and classes; discover test files in the affected workspace.

**Code extraction:**
1. Parse the diff for all changed files (added, modified, deleted).
2. For each file, extract changed function/class/method names from the diff hunks.
3. Build a keyword set per file: tokenize identifiers (camelCase → `camel`, `Case`; snake_case → `snake`, `case`; PascalCase → `Pascal`, `Case`). Lowercase all tokens.

**Test extraction:**
1. Detect the active workspace from diff path prefixes:
   - Monorepo prefixes: `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `libs/`, `modules/`.
   - If a prefix is found, restrict discovery to that workspace subtree.
   - If no prefix found → search the full repository.
2. Glob for test files: `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.spec.ts`, `**/*.test.js`, `**/*.spec.js`, `**/__tests__/**/*.ts`, `**/__tests__/**/*.js` (adapt extensions to the detected stack — Python `*_test.py`, Go `*_test.go`, etc.).
3. For each test file, extract test names (strings in `it(`, `test(`, `describe(` blocks) and build a keyword set.

**Test file classification by layer** (Step 3):
- **unit**: files matching `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/**` that do NOT match integration or e2e patterns below.
- **integration**: files matching `*.integration.test.*`, `*.integration.spec.*`, or located under `__tests__/integration/`.
- **e2e**: files matching `*.e2e.*`, `*.e2e-spec.*`, or located under `e2e/`, `cypress/`, or `playwright/`.

> **No marker scanning.** Correlation is keyword-based only. Ship never emits spec-ID comments (`IMPL-REQ-XX`, `TEST-SC-XX`, etc.) into source or test files — see `ship-develop-implement` and the `ship-test-*` agents — so analyze never looks for them. Naming carries the meaning; if naming diverges from spec wording, the correct fix is to **rename the code**, not to annotate it.

---

## 5. Parallel execution — steps 1 and 2

Use the Agent tool to run Steps 1 (spec extraction) and 2 (code/test extraction) concurrently. Send both agent invocations in a single message (two tool uses). Step 3 (correlation) starts only after both complete. Pass `model: "sonnet"` to each — both extractions require structured reasoning (tokenization, marker detection, identifier parsing).

Each agent returns its result inline. Do NOT re-read files written by the parallel agents — keep the result in-memory and proceed directly to Step 3.

---

## 6. Step 3 — Correlate spec ↔ code ↔ tests

**Goal:** map each requirement to code files (implementation confidence) and each criterion/scenario to test files (coverage confidence).

### 6.1 Jaccard cache check (pipeline mode only)

> **Pipeline mode guard**: only perform the cache logic below if a scratch dir is available. In standalone mode (no scratch dir), skip the cache entirely — always compute and never write `jaccard.json`.

1. Compute `diff_hash`: SHA-256 of the full diff content (read from `diff.md` or the inline diff string).
2. Compute `spec_hash`: SHA-256 of the concatenated spec text — all REQ-XX and AC-XX descriptions **followed by every `@SC-XX` scenario block (heading + When + Then + Examples + layer tag)**, in order. Including the scenario blocks is correctness-critical: editing a scenario without touching its AC must invalidate the cache.
3. Check `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/jaccard.json`:
   - If it does not exist → compute normally.
   - If it exists: parse as JSON.
     - If parsing **fails** (corrupted/truncated) → treat as cache miss, compute normally.
     - If parsing succeeds: compare stored `diff_hash` and `spec_hash` against the computed values.
       - **Both match** → use the cached `matrix` directly. Skip all Jaccard computations and proceed to Step 4.
       - **Either differs** → discard cache and compute normally.

### 6.2 Requirement → code mapping (Jaccard similarity)

For each `REQ-XX`:
- Build the requirement keyword set: tokenize the REQ-XX description.
- For each changed file's keyword set: compute Jaccard similarity = `|intersection| / |union|`.
- Best match confidence = highest Jaccard score across all files.
- Best match file = file with the highest score.

### 6.3 Criterion → test mapping (Test Scope-aware)

For each `AC-XX`, for each test layer (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`):
1. If the layer is **disabled** in `test_scope` → do NOT emit a finding for missing coverage in this layer. Instead, record the AC-ID in `informational_disabled_layers[layer]` (e.g., `{ integration: [AC-03, AC-07] }`). Skip all further matching for this layer.
2. If the layer is **enabled**:
   - Build the criterion keyword set: tokenize the AC-XX description.
   - For each test file in this layer's keyword set: compute Jaccard similarity.
   - Layer confidence = highest Jaccard score across all files in this layer.

Overall AC coverage confidence: the **best match across ALL enabled layers only**.

### 6.4 Scenario → test mapping (per scenario, only its tagged layer)

Skip this tier entirely if the spec has no `@SC-\d+` scenarios. Otherwise, for each `SC-XX` evaluate **only the single layer named in its `@layer` tag**:

1. If that layer is **disabled** in `test_scope` → do NOT emit a finding. Record the SC-ID in `informational_disabled_layers[layer]` alongside any ACs. Skip further matching for this scenario.
2. If the layer is **enabled**: Jaccard between the scenario's Gherkin-aware keyword set (When+Then+Examples headers) and each test file's keyword set in this layer. Scenario confidence = highest score in this layer.

### 6.5 Jaccard cache save (pipeline mode only)

> Skip in standalone mode.

After all Jaccard computations complete (skipped if the cache was reused), write `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/jaccard.json`:

```json
{
  "diff_hash": "<sha256 of diff content>",
  "spec_hash": "<sha256 of concatenated spec text>",
  "matrix": {
    "REQ-01": { "code": ["src/foo.ts:10"], "score": 0.7 },
    "AC-01":  { "tests": ["test/foo.test.ts:42"], "score": 0.9 },
    "SC-01":  { "tests": ["test/foo.test.ts:42"], "score": 0.9, "layer": "unit", "ac": "AC-01" }
  }
}
```

### 6.6 Edge cases and confidence interpretation

- **All layers disabled:** if `unit`, `integration`, and `e2e` are all `disabled`, no TEST-category findings are emitted. All ACs land in `informational_disabled_layers`. The gate evaluates only IMPL/DRIFT findings (REQ-XX). This mirrors `/ship:test` behavior when all layers are disabled.

**Confidence interpretation:**
- Confidence = 0 → not found (unimplemented / uncovered).
- 0 < confidence < 0.5 → uncertain match (low confidence).
- Confidence ≥ 0.5 → implemented / tested.

### Trigger conditions — quick reference (all seven passes)

Quick reference for every pass that can produce a finding, kept close to the passes themselves so it stays easy to audit against each pass's own section below.

| # | Pass | Category | Trigger condition |
|---|------|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | Coverage mapping | IMPL / TEST / SCENARIO / DRIFT | REQ-XX/AC-XX/SC-XX confidence below the 0.5 threshold (or exactly 0) against code/test keyword sets (§6.2–§6.4) |
| 2 | Reverse orphan detection | ORPHAN | A changed file/function (after ignore-list exclusion) has confidence = 0 against every REQ-XX (§6.7) |
| 3 | Duplication (DUP) | DUP | A REQ×REQ or AC×AC pair reaches Jaccard similarity ≥ 0.8 (§6.8) |
| 4 | Terminology (TERM) | TERM | Two distinct terms in the spec plausibly denote the same concept (shared root/stem or explicit juxtaposition) (§6.9) |
| 5 | Ambiguity (AMBIG) | AMBIG | A vague-terms dictionary hit is confirmed by the LLM rubric as lacking a measurable threshold, after a local pre-filter and batch cap select the candidate REQ-XX/AC-XX (§6.10) |
| 6 | Underspecification (SUBSPEC) | SUBSPEC | LLM rubric confirms a requirement/criterion has no verifiable AC/condition, after a local pre-filter and batch cap select the candidate REQ-XX (§6.11) |
| 7 | Principle violation (PRINCIPLE) | PRINCIPLE | LLM rubric confirms a stated project/spec convention is violated (§6.12) |

### 6.7 Reverse orphan detection

**Goal:** detect changed files/functions that have no matching requirement — the reverse direction of §6.2 (which maps REQ-XX → code; this pass maps code → REQ-XX).

1. Reuse the Step 2 (§4) changed file/function keyword sets as-is. Run one reverse pass per changed file/function — do not extract any new keyword sets for this pass.
2. Before evaluating an item, exclude it if it matches this ignore-list:
   - Lockfiles: `*.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - Config: `*.config.*`, `tsconfig*.json`, `.eslintrc*`
   - Generated code: `*.generated.*`, `dist/`, `build/`

   Excluded items are never evaluated by the reverse pass and never appear in `## Orphans` or `## Gaps`.
3. For each remaining changed file/function, compute its best-match confidence against every `REQ-XX` keyword set, reusing the same Jaccard engine from §6.2 (`|intersection| / |union|`). Best match confidence = highest score across all `REQ-XX`; best match REQ = the `REQ-XX` with that score.
4. If the best-match confidence is 0 against every `REQ-XX`, the file/function is an **orphan**.
5. **Edge case — empty diff:** if the diff has zero changed files, skip the reverse pass entirely. Do not run it and do not emit any orphan findings; the `## Orphans` section must not render (see §7.1).
6. **Backward compatibility:** this pass only operates over Step 2's file/function keyword sets — never over `@SC-XX` scenarios. No scenario-based orphan may ever be fabricated.
7. Each orphan produces exactly one finding: severity `medium`, category `ORPHAN` (see # Severity Definitions

## Performance

- **critical**: Will cause visible performance degradation in production (e.g., N+1 on every request, full table scan on large table)
- **high**: Likely to cause issues under load (e.g., missing pagination on growing dataset)
- **medium**: Suboptimal but will not cause immediate issues (e.g., missing cache on moderately accessed data)
- **low**: Best practice not followed, marginal impact (e.g., synchronous logging in low-traffic endpoint)

## Security

- **critical**: Remote exploitation without authentication, unrestricted access to sensitive data. Requires immediate fix.
- **high**: Exploitation possible with authentication or specific conditions. Significant impact risk.
- **medium**: Hard to exploit but relevant impact, or easy to exploit with limited impact.
- **low**: Theoretical risk, defense-in-depth, or best practice not followed.

## Code Review

- **critical**: Architectural issue that will cause significant problems if not addressed (e.g., circular dependency, broken abstraction that leaks implementation details across the entire system)
- **high**: Significant design issue that will make the code hard to maintain/extend (e.g., god class, tight coupling between modules)
- **medium**: Code smell that should be addressed but does not block (e.g., duplicated logic, overly complex conditional)
- **low**: Minor improvement opportunity (e.g., naming could be clearer, slightly long function)

## Frontend

Uses Core Web Vitals thresholds:

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5s – 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | 200ms – 500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 – 0.25 | > 0.25 |
| FCP | ≤ 1.8s | 1.8s – 3.0s | > 3.0s |
| TTFB | ≤ 800ms | 800ms – 1800ms | > 1800ms |

- **critical**: Core Web Vital in "Poor" range; severely impacting UX or conversion
- **high**: Core Web Vital in "Needs Improvement"; measurable impact on bounce/conversion
- **medium**: Relevant technical inefficiency, no immediate critical impact
- **low**: Incremental optimization, good for backlog

## Database

- **critical**: Causes active production degradation, data risk, or imminent failure as data grows
- **high**: Significant performance degradation that worsens with data growth
- **medium**: Relevant inefficiency, no immediate critical impact
- **low**: Best practice not followed, marginal impact

## Drift (Spec ↔ Code ↔ Test conformance)

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| critical | Requirement has zero code matches (confidence = 0) — completely unimplemented | REQ-05 not found anywhere in diff |
| high | Requirement has low confidence match (0 < confidence < 0.5) — implementation uncertain | REQ-03 found in loosely related file, confidence 0.2 |
| medium | Acceptance criterion has zero test matches — criterion not tested | AC-07 not covered by any test |
| medium | Scenario has zero test matches in its tagged enabled layer — scenario not tested | SC-09 (@integration) not covered by any test |
| low | Acceptance criterion has low confidence test match — coverage uncertain | AC-12 mentioned in unrelated test, confidence 0.1 |
| low | Scenario has low confidence test match — coverage uncertain | SC-04 loosely matched, confidence 0.2 |
| medium | Changed code/function has no match against any requirement — orphan implementation | A new function in the diff matches no documented requirement |
| low | Duplicate requirement/criterion — same behavior described more than once | Two acceptance criteria describe the same behavior in different wording |
| medium | Vague term with no measurable threshold | Requirement text uses "fast" with no numeric threshold |
| medium | Underspecified item — e.g. a requirement without acceptance criteria | A requirement has no acceptance criteria defined |
| medium | Violation of a stated principle or documented project convention | Code diverges from a documented project convention |
| low | Terminology inconsistency between spec and code | Spec says "cache invalidation", code says "eviction" without being flagged as a rename |

> **No override markers.** Correlation is keyword-based only. Ship never emits spec-ID comments (`IMPL-REQ-XX`, `IMPL-SC-XX`, `TEST-REQ-XX`, `TEST-AC-XX`, `TEST-SC-XX`) into source or test files, so the drift/coverage analyzers never scan for them. When requirement names don't match code naming (e.g., spec says "cache invalidation" but code uses "eviction"), the item surfaces as **uncertain** — the fix is to rename the code/test to match the spec vocabulary, never to annotate it with a marker comment.

## Severity Overrides

Before applying standard gate rules (`critical|high → fail`, `medium → warn`), check if `ship/config.md` contains a `## Severity Overrides` section. If present, apply matching overrides before evaluating the gate.

### Format

```
## Severity Overrides
- <phase>: <from-severity>→<to-severity>
```

Where `<phase>` must be one of the valid pipeline phases: `dev`, `test`, `analyze`, `perf`, `security`, `review`, `frontend-perf`, `database`, `backend`.

### How to apply

1. Read all entries under `## Severity Overrides` in `ship/config.md`.
2. For each finding in the current phase, check if an override matches (`phase` + `from-severity`).
3. If matched, replace the finding's effective severity with `to-severity` before the gate decision.
4. Apply standard gate rules to the (possibly overridden) effective severities.

### Validation

If an override entry references an unknown phase (not in the valid phase list above), emit an error and stop:

```
Severity override refers to unknown phase: <phase-name>
```

Do not silently ignore unknown phase overrides — fail fast to prevent misconfiguration.

### Examples

**Example 1 — Downgrade perf high to warn**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- perf: high→warn
```

Effect: A `high` finding in the `perf` phase becomes effective severity `warn` (medium gate level). Gate decision: WARN instead of FAIL.

**Example 2 — Downgrade frontend-perf high to warn**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- frontend-perf: high→warn
```

Effect: LCP "Needs Improvement" findings (`high`) in the `frontend-perf` phase generate a WARN gate instead of FAIL. Security, review, and other phases are unaffected.

**Example 3 — Multiple overrides**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- perf: high→warn
- security: medium→low
```

Effect: `high` perf findings → WARN gate; `medium` security findings → treated as `low` (PASS if no other critical/high). Each phase applies only its own override. and ## Drift Analysis Findings {#drift-findings}

Used by `/ship:analyze` phase. Extends the base Finding Entry with drift-specific fields.

}
```

--- — do not redefine either here), named explicitly by `file:line` or `file#functionName`/class identifier (same identifier granularity as the Step 2 extraction that yielded it).

### 6.8 Duplication pass (DUP)

**Goal:** detect same-tier spec items (REQ×REQ or AC×AC) that describe the same behavior in different wording.

1. Reuse the Step 1 (§3) REQ-XX and AC-XX keyword sets as-is. Do not extract any new keyword sets for this pass and do not use the Jaccard cache (§6.1/§6.5) — always compute fresh, never persist DUP results into `jaccard.json`.
2. Build the pair set: every unordered pair of items within the same tier — `{REQ-XX, REQ-YY}` pairs among all REQs, and `{AC-XX, AC-YY}` pairs among all ACs. Never pair a REQ with an AC.
3. For each pair, compute similarity with the same Jaccard engine from §6.2 (`|intersection| / |union|` over each item's own description keyword set).
4. **Threshold: 0.8.** A pair with similarity ≥ 0.8 triggers a finding.
5. A single item may appear in more than one reported pair. Dedupe only by unordered pair — never dedupe by item.
6. Each triggered pair produces exactly one finding: severity `low`, category `DUP` (see the severity.md pattern (included above) and the Drift Findings section (included above) — do not redefine either here), naming both IDs.
7. **Edge case — fewer than two items in a tier:** if a tier (REQ or AC) has zero or one item, skip pair generation for that tier entirely.
8. No pair reaches the threshold → no `DUP` findings; the `## Gaps` entries for `DUP` are simply absent (mirrors §6.7's empty-result rule).

### 6.9 Terminology pass (TERM)

**Goal:** detect divergent terms across the spec's REQ/AC/SC descriptions that plausibly denote the same concept.

1. Reuse the Step 1 (§3) REQ-XX, AC-XX, and SC-XX keyword sets as-is (same tokenization as §3/§6.2 — camelCase/snake_case/PascalCase → lowercase tokens). Do not extract any new keyword sets and do not use the Jaccard cache — always compute fresh, never persist TERM results into `jaccard.json`.
2. Build a frequency table of every token/token-group across all spec descriptions in scope.
3. Flag a pair of distinct terms as a divergence candidate when either signal holds:
   - **Shared root/stem tokens:** the two terms share their non-stopword tokens after lowercase tokenization (e.g., `token` + `de` + `acesso` vs `access` + `token` share the token `token`), and the surrounding description phrasing indicates both refer to the same concept.
   - **Explicit juxtaposition:** the spec text itself places both terms side by side or in apposition referring to one concept (e.g., "token de acesso (access token)").
4. Do not introduce a semantic model, stemming, or NLP machinery beyond the lightweight signals above — if neither signal holds, do not flag the pair.
5. Each triggered pair produces exactly one finding: severity `low`, category `TERM` (see the severity.md pattern (included above) and the Drift Findings section (included above) — do not redefine either here), naming both divergent terms.
6. No divergent pair found → no `TERM` findings; the `## Gaps` entries for `TERM` are simply absent (mirrors §6.7's empty-result rule).

**Cache bypass (§6.10–§6.12):** AMBIG, SUBSPEC, and PRINCIPLE never read from or write to `jaccard.json` — they always compute fresh. These three passes are semantic (LLM-rubric-judged), not Jaccard-similarity-based like §6.2/§6.8/§6.9, and they run far less often than the main coverage loop, so recomputing on every `/ship:analyze` run is cheaper than adding a second cache layer for them.

### 6.10 Ambiguity pass (AMBIG)

**Goal:** detect REQ-XX/AC-XX items that carry a qualitative attribute with no measurable threshold.

1. Reuse the Step 1 (§3) REQ-XX and AC-XX descriptions as-is (cache bypass — see above).
2. Pre-filter: for each REQ-XX/AC-XX description, check it against the `# Vague Terms Dictionary

Lookup of vague/qualitative terms commonly found in requirement/AC prose that lack a
measurable threshold. Keyed by artifact language (see `ship/config.md → Artifact language`).

This dictionary is a **pre-filter**: a hit here means "candidate for LLM confirmation", not
an automatic finding. A term accompanied by an explicit measurable threshold in the same
clause (e.g. "rápido (< 200ms)", "fast (p95 < 200ms)") must not be flagged by the consumer.
Severity, schema, and reporting format are defined elsewhere (`src/patterns/severity.md`,
`src/report-templates.md`), not here.

## Consumption

Consumed via `the vague-terms.md pattern (included above)` (Mechanism A — build-time inline; agents only
support inline, per `src/patterns/skill-patterns-convention.md`) by the AMBIG pre-filter.` entries for the active `Artifact language` (pt-BR or en dictionary). A term match selects the item as a candidate for LLM confirmation. No dictionary hit → no candidate, skip the item entirely.
3. **Batch cap:** dispatch at most 20 AMBIG sub-agents per `/ship:analyze` run. If the pre-filtered candidate set exceeds 20 items, process it in sequential batches of up to 20 sub-agents each (parallel within a batch, batches run one after another) until every candidate has been evaluated.
4. For each surviving candidate, dispatch a sub-agent (Agent tool, `model: "sonnet"`) with a fixed rubric: "does the item contain a qualitative attribute with no measurable threshold?" Instruct the sub-agent explicitly to check whether the matched term is accompanied, in the same clause, by an explicit measurable threshold (e.g., "< 200ms", "p95 < 200ms", "≥ 99.9%") — if a threshold is present, the sub-agent must return a negative confirmation (not ambiguous).
5. Each sub-agent returns strict JSON conforming to `#drift-findings` (the Drift Findings section (included above)) — no free-form prose.
6. A positive LLM confirmation produces exactly one finding: severity `medium`, category `AMBIG` (see the severity.md pattern (included above) and the Drift Findings section (included above) — do not redefine either here), naming the item (REQ-XX or AC-XX).
7. A negative confirmation (measurable threshold present, or the rubric otherwise finds no ambiguity) produces no finding for that item.
8. No candidate found by the pre-filter, or no candidate confirmed by the LLM → no `AMBIG` findings; the `## Gaps` entries for `AMBIG` are simply absent (mirrors §6.7's empty-result rule).

### 6.11 Underspecification pass (SUBSPEC)

**Goal:** detect REQ-XX items that lack a testable acceptance criterion, or AC-XX items whose condition is not verifiable.

1. Reuse the Step 1 (§3) REQ-XX and AC-XX keyword sets and their AC-to-REQ linkage as-is (cache bypass — see §6.10 preamble).
2. **Pre-filter (local, no LLM):** a REQ-XX is a candidate for LLM confirmation only if it plausibly lacks a testable acceptance criterion — i.e. it has zero linked AC-XX, or every one of its linked AC-XX descriptions has no explicit measurable condition/threshold (no comparison operator, unit, percentage, or numeric bound in the text). A REQ-XX with at least one linked AC-XX that already states an explicit measurable condition/threshold is resolved locally as "not underspecified" and skipped — no sub-agent dispatch for it.
3. **Batch cap:** dispatch at most 20 SUBSPEC sub-agents per `/ship:analyze` run. If the pre-filtered candidate set exceeds 20 REQ-XX, process it in sequential batches of up to 20 sub-agents each (parallel within a batch, batches run one after another) until every candidate has been evaluated.
4. For each surviving candidate REQ-XX, dispatch a sub-agent (Agent tool, `model: "sonnet"`) with a fixed rubric: "does this requirement have a testable acceptance criterion? does each of its acceptance criteria have a verifiable pass/fail condition?"
5. Each sub-agent returns strict JSON conforming to `#drift-findings` (the Drift Findings section (included above)) — no free-form prose.
6. A REQ-XX with zero linked AC-XX, or an AC-XX whose condition the sub-agent judges not verifiable, produces exactly one finding per violating item: severity `medium`, category `SUBSPEC` (see the severity.md pattern (included above) and the Drift Findings section (included above) — do not redefine either here), naming the item (REQ-XX or AC-XX).
7. No candidate found by the pre-filter, or no violation confirmed by the LLM → no `SUBSPEC` findings; the `## Gaps` entries for `SUBSPEC` are simply absent (mirrors §6.7's empty-result rule).

### 6.12 Principle-violation pass (PRINCIPLE)

**Goal:** detect items that violate a convention the project or spec explicitly declares.

1. Locate declared conventions in the loaded spec/design artifacts — e.g. a `## Conventions` section (or equivalent) in the proposal, design, or `ship/config.md`. If no convention is declared anywhere in scope, skip this pass entirely (no sub-agent dispatch, no findings).
2. If at least one convention is declared, dispatch a sub-agent (Agent tool, `model: "sonnet"`) with a fixed rubric checking adherence of each REQ-XX/AC-XX to the declared conventions, passing the convention text and the spec items as input.
3. The sub-agent returns strict JSON conforming to `#drift-findings` (the Drift Findings section (included above)) — no free-form prose (cache bypass — see §6.10 preamble).
4. Each confirmed violation produces exactly one finding: severity `medium`, category `PRINCIPLE` (see the severity.md pattern (included above) and the Drift Findings section (included above) — do not redefine either here), naming the violating item.
5. No convention declared, or no violation confirmed → no `PRINCIPLE` findings; the `## Gaps` entries for `PRINCIPLE` are simply absent (mirrors §6.7's empty-result rule).

**Parallel execution (§6.10–§6.12):** within each batch, dispatch every sub-agent required by the AMBIG, SUBSPEC, and PRINCIPLE passes in a single message — up to 20 AMBIG candidates per batch (§6.10, subject to its pre-filter and batch cap), up to 20 REQ-XX in scope for SUBSPEC per batch (§6.11, subject to its pre-filter and batch cap), and one for PRINCIPLE if a convention is declared (§6.12). All tool uses within a batch belong to the same message/turn, following the same parallelism convention as Steps 1/2 (§5) and documented in # Parallelism Strategy

- Use the **Agent** tool to launch N agents in parallel in a **SINGLE call**
- Never execute sequentially what can be parallel
- Each parallel agent writes to separate files to avoid race conditions
- When classifying workspaces (monorepo): cross-reference the diff/source tree with workspaces in `ship/config.md`, launch one agent per affected workspace
- **Cross-phase parallelism** (`/ship:run`): when `dev` and `test` are both enabled and `plan.md` exists, dispatch `ship:develop` and `ship:test Mode: generate` via the **Skill tool** in the same assistant turn — unlike the within-phase fan-outs above (one orchestrator launching several agents), this pairs two independent forked skills. Safe because `plan.md`'s module map and the denylist it derives for `ship:test` guarantee disjoint file sets between the two dispatches
- **Never use `run_in_background: true`** (Agent tool) or a backgrounded `Bash` call to dispatch any phase, worker, or leaf agent anywhere in the Ship pipeline. Every dispatch in Ship — within a phase (e.g. `ship-develop-implement` workers) or across phases (`ship:develop` + `ship:test Mode: generate`, or `perf`+`security`+`review`+`analyze`) — is a **synchronous** tool call: multiple `tool_use` blocks issued in the same assistant turn, which the harness runs concurrently but whose results the orchestrator always awaits before proceeding. "Parallel" in this document means exactly that, never an async/background dispatch. No SKILL.md or agent definition in Ship contains any logic to resume a phase from a background-completion notification — if a phase is dispatched in the background instead, the orchestrator has no way to wait for or consume its result, and will incorrectly consolidate/gate on incomplete data., but the total count varies with spec size instead of being fixed at three. If either AMBIG or SUBSPEC exceeds its 20-item cap, its remaining candidates are processed in subsequent batches, run sequentially after the first. The orchestrating agent collects and merges every returned JSON result across all batches; it does not re-derive findings from them.

## 7. Step 4 — Generate report

**Findings classification**

| Severity | Condition | Category |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| critical | REQ-XX has confidence = 0 (zero code matches) | IMPL |
| high | REQ-XX has 0 < confidence < 0.5 (uncertain) | DRIFT |
| medium | AC-XX has confidence = 0 (zero test matches) | TEST |
| medium | SC-XX has confidence = 0 in its tagged enabled layer | SCENARIO |
| low | AC-XX has 0 < confidence < 0.5 (uncertain) | DRIFT |
| low | SC-XX has 0 < confidence < 0.5 (uncertain) | DRIFT |
| medium | Changed file/function has confidence = 0 against every REQ-XX (after ignore-list exclusion) | ORPHAN |
| low | REQ×REQ or AC×AC pair with similarity ≥ threshold | DUP |
| low | Two distinct terms denote the same concept | TERM |
| medium | Vague-terms dictionary hit confirmed by LLM rubric as lacking a measurable threshold | AMBIG |
| medium | LLM rubric confirms a requirement with no AC or an AC with no verifiable condition | SUBSPEC |
| medium | LLM rubric confirms violation of a declared project/spec convention | PRINCIPLE |

See the severity.md pattern (included above) (## Drift) for full severity definitions.
See the Drift Findings section (included above) for the drift finding-entry format and per-finding fields (the full report layout below is inline because that anchor does not carry the Status tables or the `scenarioId`/`layer` JSON fields).

**Gate decision (derived purely from the severity table above, considering only findings from enabled layers):**

The gate is not a separate judgment call — it is a direct function of the severities assigned in the classification table above, aggregated across all six passes (coverage/IMPL/DRIFT/TEST/SCENARIO, ORPHAN, DUP, TERM, AMBIG, SUBSPEC, PRINCIPLE):
- Any `critical` or `high` finding → **FAIL**.
- Any `medium` finding (no critical/high) → **WARN**.
- Only `low` or no findings → **PASS**.
- Findings from **disabled** layers are never counted toward the gate — they appear only in the informational block.

See # Gate Rules

Gate decision rules applied after every quality phase:

- Any `critical` or `high` finding → **FAIL**
- Any `medium` finding → **WARN**
- Only `low` or no findings → **PASS**

Gate behavior on FAIL/WARN is configured in `ship/config.md → Gate Behavior` (`on_fail`, `on_warn`).

> See `worker-status.md` for the orthogonal completion axis (DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED) — a worker's completion state is independent of the PASS/WARN/FAIL gate result documented here.

## Snapshot pré-fix

> **No commits happen during the pipeline.** `ship:develop` and the auto-fix Agent write to the working tree; the first commit is created only in `ship:pr`. So HEAD does not advance, and any `git diff <sha> HEAD` is always empty. Re-run scoping must therefore compare working-tree snapshots, not commits.

Two distinct artifacts:

1. **`pre-quality-snapshot.sha`** — the HEAD SHA captured at step 0.5, before any quality agent starts. It is a baseline/diagnostic reference for the pre-quality HEAD. (It is **not** used to compute the fix diff — HEAD never moves — and the PR agent builds its diff directly from the working tree via `git diff`/`git status`.)

   - **File:** `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/pre-quality-snapshot.sha`
   - **Format:** single line containing the SHA from `git rev-parse HEAD`.

2. **`pre-fix-files.txt`** — a per-file content snapshot (`<hash> <path>` per changed file) captured **immediately before the auto-fix Agent runs**. After the fix, the orchestrator recomputes the same snapshot and diffs the two to determine exactly which files the fix touched (see *Re-run cirúrgico* below). This is what drives the `on_fail_rerun` scoping.

**Flag `on_fail_rerun`** (configured in `ship/config.md → Gate Behavior`):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `surgical` *(default)* | After auto-fix is applied, re-run **only the phases that failed or warned**. Phases that already passed are skipped. |
| `all` | After auto-fix is applied, re-run **all quality phases** (perf, security, review) regardless of their previous result. |

> **Scope note:** M5.1 establishes the schema and snapshot capture step only. The actual re-run logic that reads `on_fail_rerun` and selects which phases to re-launch is implemented in M5.2.

## Re-run cirúrgico

After auto-fix is applied (on_fail: fix or on_warn: fix), the orchestrator selects which quality phases to re-run based on the `on_fail_rerun` config flag.

### Phase → scope mapping

| Phase | Scope | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `perf` | Files matching `src/**` or `lib/**`, excluding `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `**/__tests__/**` | Performance issues are in hot paths, not test code |
| `security` | All files in the diff | Security scope is intentionally broad — any file could introduce a vulnerability |
| `review` | All files in the original diff | Review covers everything that changed |

### Algorithm (surgical mode)

1. Capture the pre-fix snapshot (`pre-fix-files.txt`) before the fix Agent runs
2. After the fix, recompute the snapshot (`post-fix-files.txt`) and `comm -13` the two to get the files the fix changed (working-tree comparison — **not** `git diff <sha> HEAD`, which is always empty since nothing is committed mid-pipeline). See `run.md` → Surgical Re-run Procedure for the exact commands.
3. For each phase that previously ran:
   - Compute intersection of (modified files) and (phase scope)
   - If intersection is non-empty → re-run phase
   - If intersection is empty → skip phase
4. Log decision (see format below)
5. Launch selected phases in parallel

Steps 2-3 (computing the modified-files intersection against each phase's scope and deciding whether to re-run) are implemented by the hook `src/hooks/rerun-scope.sh`, invoked via `@@ship/hooks/rerun-scope.sh` from `run/SKILL.md`. It takes the fix's changed-files list as input and applies the same scope rules from the *Phase → scope mapping* table above, returning JSON in the shape:

```json
{"phases":{"perf":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."},"security":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."},"review":{"rerun":false,"reason":"..."},"analyze":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."}},"out_of_scope":false,"empty":false}
```

`run/SKILL.md`'s Surgical Re-run Procedure invokes this script directly and consumes its JSON output rather than computing the intersection in prose.

### Log format

```
Fix tocou: <file1>, <file2> (<N> arquivo(s))
Re-run cirúrgico: <phase1> (<reason>), <phase2> (<reason>)
Re-run pulado: <phase3> (não analisava arquivos modificados), <phase4> (não analisava arquivos modificados)
```

### Behavior with `on_fail_rerun: all`

When `on_fail_rerun: all`, skip the scope mapping entirely and re-run all quality phases that were originally enabled. This is the "safe" fallback — guaranteed to catch any regression introduced by the fix.

## Example: analyze phase in phase-status.md

`analyze` dispatches in the same Phase 4 parallel turn as `perf`/`security`/`review` and its findings feed the same single aggregated gate in Phase 5 (see `run/SKILL.md` → Phase 4/5) — it does not run a second gate cycle of its own. Its row in `phase-status.md` follows the identical run/timestamp/gate schema as the other three:

```markdown
| analyze | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:07:00Z | 5 | warn | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 criterios sem testes |
| analyze | #2 | 2026-05-01T10:12:00Z | 5 | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | re-run cirúrgico |
```

### analyze phase scope mapping (Surgical Re-run)

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `analyze` | All files in the original diff (broad scope — re-run if any file changed by fix) |

The analyze phase is always re-run after a fix because spec↔code correlation depends on the entire diff, not individual files.

## Re-run: edge cases

The following edge cases apply to both `on_fail: fix` and `on_warn: fix` paths. They are enforced inside the **Surgical Re-run Procedure** in `run.md`.

### Edge case 1 — Fix vazio (sem mudanças)

**Trigger:** the pre-fix vs post-fix snapshot comparison (`comm -13`) returns an empty file list after the fix agent runs.

**Behavior:**
- Skip all re-run phases (nothing changed, nothing to validate).
- Log: `⚠ Fix não produziu mudanças. Re-run ignorado.`
- For each phase that failed/warned: write a new row in `phase-status.md` with gate=`warn` and notes=`fix sem mudanças — revisão manual necessária`.
- Continue to acceptance with the warning visible.

### Edge case 2 — Loop de re-runs (máximo 3 iterações)

**Trigger:** `$FIX_ITERATION` counter exceeds 3 (i.e., the pipeline has already cycled through fix→re-run three times without resolving the gate).

**Behavior:**
- Abort the pipeline immediately.
- Inform the user: "Limite de 3 iterações fix→re-run atingido. Intervenção manual necessária."
- Do NOT proceed to acceptance — wait for user action.

### Edge case 3 — `on_warn: fix` usa lógica cirúrgica

**Trigger:** Gate returns exit code 1 (WARN) and `on_warn` is set to `fix`.

**Behavior:** Identical to `on_fail: fix` — apply the full Surgical Re-run Procedure including all edge cases (empty fix, iteration limit, out-of-scope files). No special handling for warnings vs failures.

### Edge case 4 — Fix tocou arquivo fora do scope original

**Trigger:** After the fix, the snapshot comparison returns a file that does not match any phase scope rule (not under `src/**`, `lib/**`, or any recognized path from the scope mapping table).

**Behavior:**
- Re-run ALL originally enabled quality phases (conservative mode — the fix touched unknown territory).
- Log: `Fix tocou arquivo(s) fora do scope original (<file>). Re-run conservador: todas as fases ativadas.`
- Do NOT apply surgical scoping — launch all phases in parallel as in Phase 4. for gate rules and severity override handling.

**Before finalizing findings**, apply severity overrides: read `Severity Overrides` from injected context (or `ship/config.md → Severity Overrides` if not injected). For each override rule (e.g., `high → warn`), downgrade any matching findings accordingly. If the field is absent, no downgrade is applied.

### 7.2 Lazy-load rendering (user-facing output)

Apply the lazy-load algorithm from ---
# Lazy-Load Findings Algorithm

Canonical algorithm for consolidating phase findings into acceptance and quality reports.
Referenced by `homolog.md` (both Linear and Local mode).

`phase-status.md` is the canonical gate index — it is **always** read first (in step 1.4 of homolog's "Load all artifacts"). The algorithm below assumes it is already in memory; do NOT re-read it.

---

## Algorithm

`phase-status.md` has structured columns: `Phase | Run | Timestamp | Files | Gate | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Notes`.

For each phase (perf, security, review):

1. **Look up the gate** from the `phase-status.md` table — take the **last row** for that phase (most recent run).
   - If the phase has no row in `phase-status.md`: treat as `FAIL` (safe default)
2. **Branch on gate status:**

### If gate = PASS

Emit a single summary line — do **NOT** open the findings markdown:

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

Translate the user-facing text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`.

### If gate = WARN or FAIL

Open the findings markdown file for this phase, then filter before embedding:
- Include all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium` in full
- For `low` severity findings: replace the full list with a single aggregated line:
  `+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)`
- Translate the aggregated line text to `Artifact language` from `ship/config.md`

## Link/reference (always required)

- **Linear mode:** URL of the Linear comment containing the full findings; if the comment has not been posted yet (it is posted in step 6 of `homolog.md`), write `(full report will be attached to this issue)`
- **Local mode:** relative path `ship/changes/<feature>/report-<task-id>.md`. When presenting the drift report to the user:

- **Gate = PASS**: emit a single summary line — do NOT embed findings:
  ```
  ✓ Drift Analysis: PASS (0 gaps) — [ver relatório completo](<link or scratch dir path>)
  ```
- **Gate = WARN or FAIL**: embed all `critical`, `high`, and `medium` findings in full — this applies to both the `## Gaps` section (using the format above) and the `## Orphans` section (medium-severity ORPHAN rows), neither is ever collapsed. Replace ALL `low` findings, in either section, with a single aggregated line:
  ```
  + N achados de severidade baixa — [ver relatório completo](<link or scratch dir path>)
  ```

The full `drift-report.md` is always persisted to the scratch dir. The lazy-load rendering applies only to the **user-facing output** and to the Linear comment (if Linear mode).

---

## 8. Persist results

**Scratch dir (always, when available):**
- Write `drift-report.md` to `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/drift-report.md`.
- Write `drift-findings.json` to `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/drift-findings.json`. Format: array of finding objects, each with `id`, `severity`, `category`, `description`, `suggestion`, and the relevant ID field (`requirementId` | `criterionId` | `scenarioId`).

**Linear mode:**
- Post the drift report summary as a comment on the task issue via `mcp__linear-server__save_comment`. Comment format: one-line gate result + collapsible full report block. Do NOT write `drift-report.md` to `ship/changes/` in Linear mode.

**Local mode:**
- Also write `drift-report.md` to `ship/changes/<feature>/drift-report.md`.

**Write phase status (pipeline mode):**

Write (overwrite, do not append) your row to `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/phase-status-analyze.md` (if the scratch dir exists) — never write directly to the shared `phase-status.md`, since this phase runs concurrently with `perf`/`security`/`review` in the same turn and a concurrent append would race:

```
| analyze | #<RUN> | <ISO-8601 UTC> | <total-reqs+criteria+scenarios> | <gate> | <critical> | <high> | <medium> | <low> | |
```

Leave `#<RUN>` as a literal placeholder — the orchestrator substitutes the real run number when it consolidates this row into `phase-status.md`.

---

## Rules

1. **Always determine storage mode first** (from injected context or `ship/config.md`). Never assume Linear or Local mode.
2. **Parallelism**: Steps 1 and 2 MUST run in parallel via the Agent tool — never sequentially.
3. **Confidence thresholds**: ≥ 0.5 = implemented/tested; 0 < confidence < 0.5 = uncertain; = 0 = unimplemented/uncovered.
4. **No marker overrides**: correlation is keyword-based only. Ship never writes spec-ID comments (`IMPL-REQ-XX`, `IMPL-SC-XX`, `TEST-REQ-XX`, `TEST-AC-XX`, `TEST-SC-XX`) into source or test files, so analyze never scans for them and never grants confidence based on them. When code or a test exists but its naming diverges from the spec wording, it surfaces as **uncertain** (0 < confidence < 0.5) — the fix is to **rename the code/test** to match the requirement, never to annotate it with a marker comment.
5. **Gate enforcement**: gate FAIL → caller's `on_fail` flow; gate WARN → caller's `on_warn` flow; gate PASS → continue. Respect `Gate Behavior` from `ship/config.md`.
6. **Monorepo awareness**: detect the active workspace from diff path prefixes (`apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `libs/`, `modules/`). Restrict test discovery and file matching to that workspace; if no prefix found, analyze the full repo.
7. **Storage isolation**: Linear mode → never create local files outside the scratch dir; Local mode → never call Linear API tools.
8. **Test Scope awareness**: before emitting any coverage finding (TEST or SCENARIO), check the layer in `Test Scope`. For SCENARIO findings the relevant layer is the scenario's own `@layer` tag. Disabled layers never generate MEDIUM/WARN findings — they appear only in `## Disabled Layers — Informational`. If `Test Scope` is absent, treat all layers as enabled.
9. **Scenario backward compatibility**: presence-based. If the spec has no `@SC-XX` scenarios, skip the scenario tier entirely, omit the Scenarios Status table and the three Scenario summary rows, and behave exactly as before. Never infer or fabricate scenarios.
10. **Language**: use the `Artifact language` passed by the caller for all user-facing output (reports, summaries, gate results). Code, identifiers, file paths, and Gherkin keywords/tags are always English.
11. **Read efficiency**: do NOT re-read files after Edit/Write. Re-read only if explicitly requested or compaction is suspected.
12. **LLM passes always use a fixed rubric + strict JSON**: AMBIG, SUBSPEC, and PRINCIPLE never rely on free-form sub-agent judgment — each dispatch carries a fixed rubric question and requires output conforming to `#drift-findings`; never accept prose-only responses from these sub-agents.
