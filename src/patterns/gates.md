# Gate Rules

## Gate Decision Rules {#gate-decision-rules}

Gate decision rules applied after every quality phase:

- Any `critical` or `high` finding → **FAIL**
- Any `medium` finding → **WARN**
- Only `low` or no findings → **PASS**

Gate behavior on FAIL/WARN is configured in `ship/config.md → Gate Behavior` (`on_fail`, `on_warn`).

> See `worker-status.md` for the orthogonal completion axis (DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED) — a worker's completion state is independent of the PASS/WARN/FAIL gate result documented here.

## Snapshot pré-fix

> **No commits happen during the pipeline.** `ship:develop` and the auto-fix Agent write to the working tree; the first commit is created only in `ship:pr`. So HEAD does not advance, and any `git diff <sha> HEAD` is always empty. Re-run scoping must therefore compare working-tree snapshots, not commits.

Two distinct artifacts:

1. **`pre-quality-snapshot.sha`** — the HEAD SHA captured by run-init (step 0.4–0.7), before any quality agent starts. It is a baseline/diagnostic reference for the pre-quality HEAD. (It is **not** used to compute the fix diff — HEAD never moves — and the PR agent builds its diff directly from the working tree via `git diff`/`git status`.)

   - **File:** `.context/ship-run/<task-id>/pre-quality-snapshot.sha`
   - **Format:** single line containing the SHA from `git rev-parse HEAD`.

2. **`pre-fix-files.txt`** — a per-file content snapshot (`<hash> <path>` per changed file) captured **immediately before the auto-fix Agent runs**. After the fix, the orchestrator recomputes the same snapshot and diffs the two to determine exactly which files the fix touched (see *Re-run cirúrgico* below). This is what drives the `on_fail_rerun` scoping.

**Flag `on_fail_rerun`** (configured in `ship/config.md → Gate Behavior`):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `surgical` *(default)* | After auto-fix is applied, re-run **only the phases that failed or warned**. Phases that already passed are skipped. |
| `all` | After auto-fix is applied, re-run **all quality phases** (perf, security, review) regardless of their previous result. |

> **Scope note:** M5.1 establishes the schema and snapshot capture step only. The actual re-run logic that reads `on_fail_rerun` and selects which phases to re-launch is implemented in M5.2.

## Re-run cirúrgico

After auto-fix is applied (on_fail: fix or on_warn: fix), the orchestrator selects which quality phases to re-run based on the `on_fail_rerun` config flag.

### Phase → scope mapping

| Phase | Scope | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `perf` | Files matching `src/**` or `lib/**`, excluding `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `**/__tests__/**` | Performance issues are in hot paths, not test code |
| `security` | All files in the diff | Security scope is intentionally broad — any file could introduce a vulnerability |
| `review` | All files in the original diff | Review covers everything that changed |

### Algorithm (surgical mode)

1. Capture the pre-fix snapshot (`pre-fix-files.txt`) before the fix Agent runs
2. After the fix, recompute the snapshot (`post-fix-files.txt`) and `comm -13` the two to get the files the fix changed (working-tree comparison — **not** `git diff <sha> HEAD`, which is always empty since nothing is committed mid-pipeline). See `run.md` → Surgical Re-run Procedure for the exact commands.
3. For each phase that previously ran:
   - Compute intersection of (modified files) and (phase scope)
   - If intersection is non-empty → re-run phase
   - If intersection is empty → skip phase
4. Log decision (see format below)
5. Launch selected phases in parallel

Steps 2-3 (computing the modified-files intersection against each phase's scope and deciding whether to re-run) are implemented by the hook `src/hooks/rerun-scope.sh`, invoked via `@@ship/hooks/rerun-scope.sh` from `run/SKILL.md`. It takes the fix's changed-files list as input (plus, optionally, the previous `drift-findings.json` as a second argument — see "analyze phase scope mapping" below) and applies the same scope rules from the *Phase → scope mapping* table above, returning JSON in the shape:

```json
{"phases":{"perf":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."},"security":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."},"review":{"rerun":false,"reason":"..."},"analyze":{"rerun":true,"reason":"..."}},"out_of_scope":false,"empty":false}
```

`run/SKILL.md`'s Surgical Re-run Procedure invokes this script directly and consumes its JSON output rather than computing the intersection in prose.

### Log format

```
Fix tocou: <file1>, <file2> (<N> arquivo(s))
Re-run cirúrgico: <phase1> (<reason>), <phase2> (<reason>)
Re-run pulado: <phase3> (não analisava arquivos modificados), <phase4> (não analisava arquivos modificados)
```

### Behavior with `on_fail_rerun: all`

When `on_fail_rerun: all`, skip the scope mapping entirely and re-run all quality phases that were originally enabled. This is the "safe" fallback — guaranteed to catch any regression introduced by the fix.

## Example: analyze phase in phase-status.md

`analyze` dispatches in the same Phase 4 parallel turn as `perf`/`security`/`review` and its findings feed the same single aggregated gate in Phase 5 (see `run/SKILL.md` → Phase 4/5) — it does not run a second gate cycle of its own. Its row in `phase-status.md` follows the identical run/timestamp/gate schema as the other three:

```markdown
| analyze | #1 | 2026-05-01T10:07:00Z | 5 | warn | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 2 criterios sem testes |
| analyze | #2 | 2026-05-01T10:12:00Z | 5 | pass | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | re-run cirúrgico |
```

### analyze phase scope mapping (Surgical Re-run)

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `analyze` | All files in the original diff (broad scope — re-run if any file changed by fix) |

The analyze phase is re-run after a fix because spec↔code correlation depends on the entire diff, not individual files. **Single exception**: when `rerun-scope.sh` receives the previous `drift-findings.json` and every finding category is spec-side (`DUP`/`TERM`/`AMBIG`/`SUBSPEC`/`PRINCIPLE`), it returns `analyze.rerun=false` — a code fix cannot alter spec-side findings, so a re-run would reproduce them verbatim. (The re-run itself is also cheap when it does happen: the deterministic correlation engine caches by diff/spec hash.)

## Re-run: edge cases

The following edge cases apply to both `on_fail: fix` and `on_warn: fix` paths. They are enforced inside the **Surgical Re-run Procedure** in `run.md`.

### Edge case 1 — Fix vazio (sem mudanças)

**Trigger:** the pre-fix vs post-fix snapshot comparison (`comm -13`) returns an empty file list after the fix agent runs.

**Behavior:**
- Skip all re-run phases (nothing changed, nothing to validate).
- Log: `⚠ Fix não produziu mudanças. Re-run ignorado.`
- For each phase that failed/warned: write a new row in `phase-status.md` with gate=`warn` and notes=`fix sem mudanças — revisão manual necessária`.
- Continue to acceptance with the warning visible.

### Edge case 2 — Loop de re-runs (máximo 3 iterações)

**Trigger:** `pipeline.sh iter <scratch-dir> fix --max 3` exits 2 — a persisted counter (`iteration-fix.txt`). It is reset **only on a fresh init**; a `resume` (a re-queued `/ship:run`, or recovery after an interruption) preserves it, so re-queuing continues the same capped loop instead of restarting it from zero. A mid-run context compaction never calls init, so the counter survives that too.

**Behavior (severity-aware exit at the cap):**
- Residue is only ≤ medium (WARN) → report the findings and advance to homolog (deferred, non-blocking) — `gate-resolved.txt` = `WARN capped-deferred`.
- Residue includes critical/high (FAIL) → abort without dispatching the fix Agent: "3 fix rounds reached and critical/high findings remain. Manual intervention required." Do NOT proceed to acceptance.

### Edge case 2b — Convergence guards (before every fix round)

Both keyed on per-finding **identity** (`<phase>|<severity>|<file>|<slug>`, `:line` stripped) via `findings-identity.sh`, accumulated in `findings-ledger.txt`. They fire before the cap so most loops stop earlier:
- **Identity fixpoint** — a re-verify round surfaces no finding not already in the ledger. Re-fixing reproduces the same set (findings a code change cannot move, or that the fix agent already failed to move) → ask the user (defer / fix manually).
- **Self-inflicted churn** — after ≥1 fix, every *new* finding this round is ≤ medium **and** sits on a file the previous fix itself touched (`fix-changed-files.txt`). These are regenerations of the fix's own churn, not the original diff's problems → report and advance to homolog (`gate-resolved.txt` = `WARN churn-deferred`); the human still sees them at acceptance.

### Edge case 3 — `on_warn: fix` usa lógica cirúrgica

**Trigger:** Gate returns exit code 1 (WARN) and `on_warn` is set to `fix`.

**Behavior:** Same Surgical Re-run Procedure as `on_fail: fix`, but WARN residue never blocks: the convergence guards and the cap defer it to homolog rather than stopping the pipeline (only critical/high stops).

### Edge case 4 — Fix tocou arquivo fora do scope original

**Trigger:** After the fix, the snapshot comparison returns a file that does not match any phase scope rule (not under `src/**`, `lib/**`, or any recognized path from the scope mapping table).

**Behavior:**
- Re-run ALL originally enabled quality phases (conservative mode — the fix touched unknown territory).
- Log: `Fix tocou arquivo(s) fora do scope original (<file>). Re-run conservador: todas as fases ativadas.`
- Do NOT apply surgical scoping — launch all phases in parallel as in Phase 4.
