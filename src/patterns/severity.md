# Severity Definitions

## Performance {#performance}

- **critical**: Will cause visible performance degradation in production (e.g., N+1 on every request, full table scan on large table)
- **high**: Likely to cause issues under load (e.g., missing pagination on growing dataset)
- **medium**: Suboptimal but will not cause immediate issues (e.g., missing cache on moderately accessed data)
- **low**: Best practice not followed, marginal impact (e.g., synchronous logging in low-traffic endpoint)

## Security {#security}

- **critical**: Remote exploitation without authentication, unrestricted access to sensitive data. Requires immediate fix.
- **high**: Exploitation possible with authentication or specific conditions. Significant impact risk.
- **medium**: Hard to exploit but relevant impact, or easy to exploit with limited impact.
- **low**: Theoretical risk, defense-in-depth, or best practice not followed.

## Code Review {#code-review}

- **critical**: Architectural issue that will cause significant problems if not addressed (e.g., circular dependency, broken abstraction that leaks implementation details across the entire system)
- **high**: Significant design issue that will make the code hard to maintain/extend (e.g., god class, tight coupling between modules)
- **medium**: Code smell that should be addressed but does not block (e.g., duplicated logic, overly complex conditional)
- **low**: Minor improvement opportunity (e.g., naming could be clearer, slightly long function)

## Frontend {#frontend}

Core Web Vitals thresholds (Good / Needs Improvement / Poor): LCP ≤2.5s / 2.5-4.0s / >4.0s · INP ≤200ms / 200-500ms / >500ms · CLS ≤0.1 / 0.1-0.25 / >0.25 · FCP ≤1.8s / 1.8-3.0s / >3.0s · TTFB ≤800ms / 800-1800ms / >1800ms.

- **critical**: Vital in "Poor" range, severe UX/conversion impact · **high**: "Needs Improvement", measurable impact · **medium**: relevant inefficiency, no immediate impact · **low**: incremental, backlog

## Database {#database}

- **critical**: Causes active production degradation, data risk, or imminent failure as data grows
- **high**: Significant performance degradation that worsens with data growth
- **medium**: Relevant inefficiency, no immediate critical impact
- **low**: Best practice not followed, marginal impact

## No override markers {#no-markers}

> Ship never emits spec-ID comments (`IMPL-REQ-XX`, `IMPL-SC-XX`, `TEST-REQ-XX`, `TEST-AC-XX`, `TEST-SC-XX`) into source or test files, so the coverage analyzer (`ship:audit:tests`, keyword-based Jaccard correlation) never scans for them. When requirement names don't match code naming (e.g., spec says "cache invalidation" but code uses "eviction"), the item surfaces as **uncertain** — the fix is to rename the code/test to match the spec vocabulary, never to annotate it with a marker comment.

## Severity Overrides

Before applying standard gate rules (`critical|high → fail`, `medium → warn`), check if `ship/config.md` contains a `## Severity Overrides` section. If present, apply matching overrides before evaluating the gate.

### Format

```
## Severity Overrides
- <phase>: <from-severity>→<to-severity>
```

Where `<phase>` must be one of the valid pipeline phases: `dev`, `test`, `perf`, `security`, `review`, `frontend-perf`, `database`, `backend`.

### How to apply

1. Read all entries under `## Severity Overrides` in `ship/config.md`.
2. For each finding in the current phase, check if an override matches (`phase` + `from-severity`).
3. If matched, replace the finding's effective severity with `to-severity` before the gate decision.
4. Apply standard gate rules to the (possibly overridden) effective severities.

### Validation

If an override entry references an unknown phase (not in the valid phase list above), emit an error and stop:

```
Severity override refers to unknown phase: <phase-name>
```

Do not silently ignore unknown phase overrides — fail fast to prevent misconfiguration.

### Examples

**Example 1 — Downgrade perf high to warn**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- perf: high→warn
```

Effect: A `high` finding in the `perf` phase becomes effective severity `warn` (medium gate level). Gate decision: WARN instead of FAIL.

**Example 2 — Downgrade frontend-perf high to warn**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- frontend-perf: high→warn
```

Effect: LCP "Needs Improvement" findings (`high`) in the `frontend-perf` phase generate a WARN gate instead of FAIL. Security, review, and other phases are unaffected.

**Example 3 — Multiple overrides**

Config:
```
## Severity Overrides
- perf: high→warn
- security: medium→low
```

Effect: `high` perf findings → WARN gate; `medium` security findings → treated as `low` (PASS if no other critical/high). Each phase applies only its own override.
