# Audit Summary Schema

Each `ship:audit:*` agent must output this JSON block as the **very last content** of its tool result. `ship:audit:run` reads it directly from the agent result (already in context) — no file I/O needed.

## Schema

```json
{
  "audit": "<backend|frontend|database|security|tests>",
  "gate": "<PASS|WARN|FAIL>",
  "score": "<A|B|C|D|F>",
  "counts": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "top_findings": [
    {
      "id": "<FINDING-ID>",
      "severity": "<critical|high|medium|low>",
      "title": "<short title>",
      "file": "<path/to/file.ts:line>"
    }
  ],
  "report_path": "ship/audits/<type>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md"
}
```

## Field definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `audit` | string | Audit type identifier |
| `gate` | `PASS\|WARN\|FAIL` | Gate result per `@ship/patterns/gates.md` |
| `score` | `A–F` | Quality score (see scoring table below) |
| `counts` | object | Finding counts by severity |
| `top_findings` | array | Up to 5 most severe findings; empty array if none |
| `report_path` | string | Relative path to the full markdown report |

## Scoring table

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | No findings, or only `low` findings |
| B | No `critical`/`high`; at least one `medium` |
| C | No `critical`; 1–2 `high` findings |
| D | No `critical`; 3+ `high` findings |
| F | At least one `critical` finding |

## Audit-specific notes

| Audit | Gate cap | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `backend` | PASS\|WARN\|FAIL | Standard gate |
| `frontend` | PASS\|WARN\|FAIL | Standard gate |
| `database` | PASS\|WARN\|FAIL | Standard gate |
| `security` | PASS\|WARN\|FAIL | Standard gate |
| `tests` | **PASS\|WARN** | HIGH findings map to WARN, not FAIL — test gaps are a quality issue, not blocking |

## Usage in `ship:audit:run`

After all parallel audit agents complete, their tool results are already in the orchestrator context. Extract the JSON block from each result — no need to re-open the markdown files. Pass the extracted JSON objects inline to any consolidation step.
