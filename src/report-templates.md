# Ship — Report Templates

Canonical source for all reporting templates used across Ship command files.
Import by reference: `See ship/report-templates.md#<anchor>`.

---

## Finding Entry {#finding-entry}

Base template. All domains share this structure.

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] <Descriptive Title>
- **Category:** <domain-specific — see extensions below>
- **File:** <path>:<line>
- **Description:** <what the problem is>
- **Impact:** <estimated impact>
- **Suggestion:** <specific fix with code example if helpful>
```

> For severity definitions per domain (critical / high / medium / low), see [`ship/patterns/severity.md`](patterns/severity.md).

### Domain extensions

Fields that **replace or add to** the base template per domain:

## Drift Analysis Findings {#drift-findings}

Used by `/ship:analyze` phase. Extends the base Finding Entry with drift-specific fields.

### Finding Entry Format

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Severity | critical \| high \| medium \| low | See severity.md — Drift domain |
| Category | IMPL \| TEST \| SCENARIO \| DRIFT \| ORPHAN \| DUP \| AMBIG \| SUBSPEC \| PRINCIPLE \| TERM | IMPL = implementation gap, TEST = AC test coverage gap, SCENARIO = scenario coverage gap, DRIFT = low-confidence match, ORPHAN = changed code/test with no matching requirement, DUP = duplicate requirement/criterion, AMBIG = vague/unmeasurable term, SUBSPEC = underspecified item, PRINCIPLE = violation of a stated principle/convention, TERM = terminology inconsistency between spec and code |
| File | path or — | Source file where the issue was detected |
| Description | string | What is missing or mismatched |
| Suggestion | string | How to fix: implement the requirement or add the missing test |
| Requirement ID | REQ-XX or — | Linked requirement, if applicable |
| Criterion ID | AC-XX or — | Linked acceptance criterion, if applicable |
| Scenario ID | SC-XX or — | Linked scenario, if applicable |
| Layer | unit \| integration \| e2e or — | Scenario's tagged test layer (SCENARIO findings only) |
| Confidence % | integer 0-100 | Match confidence rendered as an integer percentage |

### Severity Mapping

| Severity | Trigger | Gate Impact |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| critical | Requirement with 0 code matches | FAIL |
| high | Requirement confidence < 0.5 | FAIL |
| medium | Acceptance criterion with 0 test matches | WARN |
| medium | Scenario with 0 test matches in its tagged enabled layer | WARN |
| low | Criterion or scenario confidence < 0.5 | PASS |
| medium | Changed code/function has no match against any requirement (ORPHAN) | WARN |
| low | Duplicate requirement/criterion (DUP) | PASS |
| medium | Vague term with no measurable threshold (AMBIG) | WARN |
| medium | Underspecified item, e.g. a requirement without acceptance criteria (SUBSPEC) | WARN |
| medium | Violation of a stated principle or documented project convention (PRINCIPLE) | WARN |
| low | Terminology inconsistency between spec and code (TERM) | PASS |

### Example Reports

#### PASS
`✓ Análise de Drift: PASS (0 gaps) — [ver relatório completo](link)`

#### WARN (medium findings)
```
### [MEDIUM] Critério sem cobertura de teste: AC-03
- **Categoria:** TEST
- **Descrição:** O critério de aceitação "AC-03" não possui testes identificados.
- **Sugestão:** Crie um teste para o critério AC-03.
```

#### FAIL (critical findings)
```
### [CRITICAL] Requisito não implementado: REQ-05
- **Categoria:** IMPL
- **Descrição:** O requisito "REQ-05: Cache invalidation" não possui implementação identificada.
- **Sugestão:** Implemente o requisito REQ-05 no arquivo.
```

### Orphans

Rendered only when ORPHAN-category findings exist. Lists changed code/test artifacts that have no matching requirement. The rendered report starts this block with a `## Orphans` heading (analogous to `## Gaps`), followed by a table:

```markdown
| File/Identifier | Line | Best REQ match | Confidence % | Category |
|------------------|------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| src/cache/evict.ts#evictExpired | 42 | REQ-05 (baixa confiança) | 22% | ORPHAN |
```

## Lazy Mode {#lazy-mode}

Canonical rendering format for per-phase findings in quality reports and PR descriptions.
For the decision algorithm (how to determine PASS / WARN / FAIL), see @ship/patterns/lazy-load-findings.md.

### Gate = PASS — tabela-resumo

When a phase gate = PASS, emit only the compact summary table row. **No findings content is embedded.**

Format:

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

Single-phase inline variant (used inside phase subsections):

```
✓ <Phase>: PASS (0 critical/high findings) — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — all phases PASS:**

| Fase | Status | Findings críticos/altos |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Performance | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Security | ✅ PASS | 0 |
| Code Review | ✅ PASS | 0 |

### Gate = WARN or FAIL — bloco expandido

When a phase gate = WARN or FAIL, embed findings inline. Apply the filter:
- **Include in full**: all findings with severity `critical`, `high`, or `medium`
- **Aggregate**: replace all `low` findings with a single count line

Format:

```
### [HIGH] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format — see #finding-entry>

### [MEDIUM] <Title>
<finding in Finding Entry format>

+ N low-severity findings — [see full report](<link or path>)
```

**Example — Security gate = FAIL:**

### [HIGH] SQL Injection in search endpoint
- **Category:** INJ
- **File:** src/routes/search.ts:34
- **Description:** User input is interpolated directly into a raw SQL query without parameterization.
- **Impact:** Full database read/write access for an attacker.
- **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries via the ORM or prepared statements.

### [MEDIUM] Missing rate limiting on login route
- **Category:** CFG
- **File:** src/routes/auth.ts:12
- **Description:** The POST /login endpoint has no rate limit, enabling brute-force attacks.
- **Impact:** Credential enumeration and account takeover.
- **Suggestion:** Apply a rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) with a 5-attempts/minute threshold.

+ 3 low-severity findings — [see full report](https://linear.app/<workspace>/issue/<TEAM>-NNN)

## Report Summary Table {#report-summary}

Compact summary block used at the end of `/ship:perf`, `/ship:security`, `/ship:review`, and all `/ship:audit:*` reports.

```markdown
## Summary
- Critical: X
- High: X
- Medium: X
- Low: X
- **Gate: PASS | WARN | FAIL**
```
